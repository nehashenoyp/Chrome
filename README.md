# FindIT!
**FindIT helps you swiftly navigate your computer's file structure and find the files and folders you need with ease and efficiency. Our search engine allows you to quickly locate files and folders by name, extension, or content. No more endless scrolling or guesswork.**
## How it works:
1. Paste the path to the directory in which you would like to search in the search box and click on search. You might have to wait for some time to allow loading the files in      case the path is valid else an error message will be displayed.(Make sure you don't enclose the path in quotes).

   eg:/home/Documents/Studies/
2. Once the valid path is entered and processed you will see the search box where you can type in what you would like to search.
   
   eg:code files for networkingÂ lab
3. Now you can see the suggestions displayed as paths!
